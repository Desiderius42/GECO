### What project are you building 
PꝏlStake is a self-funded experiment consisting on creating series of Ethereum Smart Contracts and building tools related to pooling and staking. The idea is to provide pieces of software that allow people to leverage their number and regroup (pooling) in different kinds of settings and in a decentralized manner. Staking and staking derivatives became our main focus as we were discussing with the different blockchain projects in the space and their communities.

One of the tools that we are currently building is an insurance-like product for slashing events. In order to implement it, we will use prediction markets and build it on top of the Conditional Token Standard (Gnosis Mercury) and connect it to the Cosmos Hub as our first PoS Blockchain to insure. This will enable our users to have access to a new type of product through an insurance like market-place while bringing a solution to a current pain point in the staking process in PoS blockchain.

### Why did you decide to build it 
Marouane created several communities on social media in the past, tackling real problems of particular populations/minorities (and sometimes giving birth to small movements). When he joined the first crypto and blockchain related communities, he always thought of tools that could help them gain more power, leverage the number and the crowd-knowledge / collective intelligence. So he used PꝏlStake as a way to try to provide tools and also to learn by building and interacting with dApp users. The first tools were related to ICOs and trading, the ones we 12are focusing on building now are more related to staking as PoS will come with its own sets of challenges.

While discussing with different members of staking communities (blockchain projects, delegators, validators, block explorers, wallet providers, etc ...), Marouane and Emmanuel identified series of pain points which led them to focus on staking derivatives as possible solutions. The staking derivative with the most potential appeared to be a slashing insurance. After spending 6 weeks meeting with validators and delegators from the Cosmos Network they had a strong confirmation of their initial intuition. So they managed to collect signatures of a Letter of Intent from 13 validators representing 25% of the voting power of the Cosmos Hub. They also got the support of Wallet Providers and Block Explorers. The existence of a product/market fit combined with the possibility to solve a real pain point led them to decide to build it.

### How long will it take 
4 months with grants from both ICF (InterChain Foundation) and GECO, 6 months with a grant from GECO alone.


### How much funding are you requesting  
+ Approx. 50K€ 
+ a one million Dai credit line over one year (to kick off the project)
+ PR / Marketing assistance

### How did you hear about the GECO
> Website, Twitter, Conference and others

### Team description
**Marouane Hajji: Product / Business Lead**

Marouane first experience with code started when he was 13 years old. Later, his interest in the business world led him to get a degree from ESSEC Business School where he first studied Finance then Entrepreneurship.

He became an entrepreneur after an experience in Strategy Consulting and Finance. His time at CDO Invest in 2007 (a 4 Billions euros fund managed by AXA-IM) and the fall of Lehman Brothers while he was at Citigroup allowed him to have a hands on experience within a system that was completely broken.
As an entrepreneur he took part in the launch of WeTrillions (formerly Looly’s and Lecupboard). The impact-driven food start-up was later backed by 500 startups.

As a former smoker, he created and launched a connected vaping device to help smokers quit and get rid of their nicotine addiction, the venture later became the leading european monthly subscription box for vapers (LіquіdΒοх).

Starting from 2016 he started exploring Ethereum and pretty quickly the technology and the subsequent possibilities became an obsession for him. This led him to create and self fund PꝏlStake, a 4 people team experimenting using smart contracts to provide different sets of tools for the crypto community. After Emmanuel joined him they started focusing on staking derivatives.

**Emmanuel Lаnɡе: Tech Lead**

Emmanuel has 15 years experience as a software developer. During his years in engineering school he had a deep interest in cryptographic technology and what is now called post-quantum communication was the subject of his final year thesis. He started his career as a developer and coded the first MPEG-4 HD encoder in the world (still in use today after more than 9 years). Then he co-founded BrightLoop, the company designed and manufactured software driven  power supplies for large companies and implemented industry leading software development processes. He partially sold his shares in the company and joined SoftBank Robotics as a Project Manager then SES-Imagotag (world leader in IoT deployments) as VP of Strategic program.

Being a passionate entrepreneur he became a Station F Selection Board Committee Member and co-founded Quizflip, an EdTech developing the world’s first electronic flashcard. The lack of product/market fit led him to put the project on hold and start to explore the blockchain technology.
He spent 6 months working on Tendermint and Ethereum as a CTO of H2O, a blockchain driven startup focusing on the entertainment industry, the company got quickly acquired. As an external consultant, he was lately a part-time CTO for UNESS, a ministry of higher education backed EdTech. The entrepreneurship and blockchain passions got Emmanuel and Marouane to join forces and start exploring staking derivatives.

Emmanuel holds Masters degrees from Ecole supérieure d’électricité, Georgia Tech and an MBA from INSEAD where he is also a member of the Business Angel Selection committee.

**Julien Klepatch: Lead Dev**

Julien used to work as a Financial Engineer in banking, and he switched to software development 5 years ago, as a contractor. He built dozens of web applications with Node.js/Javascript. He also setup the technical infrastructure of several token sales. Finally, He created Ethereum DAPPS and smart contracts for several crypto projects.

Julien was Employee #1 at Lendingblock, where he built the prototype of a crypto exchange in Node. and he also teaches Ethereum Dapps & Blockchain (Blockchain training / coaching) on his youtube channel EatTheBlocks.

Beside a solid experience in full stack web development and blockchain technologies, Julien have also setup continuous integration environments, ranging from simple setups with git hooks and bash scripts to more complex deployment scenarios with Jenkins, Ansible and Terraform.

Julien holds an MSc Engineering Degree from Ecole des Mines d’Albi and a MSc in Finance Degree from HEC.

**Reza Bakhshandeh: Back-end and smart contracts**

Software Engineering bachelor and AI master degree. Reza worked previously at Boosto.io and since june 2018 on PꝏlStake, he has 14 years experience in software development and spent the last 36 months designing Tokens and Solidity Smart Contracts. He will be working part-time on the slashing insurance product under Emmanuel’s supervision.


**Muhammad Mafazine: CSS, JS and HTML wizard**

Muhammad worked with Marouane on both LіquіdΒοх and PꝏlStake, he will be working part-time on the integration part of the front-end under Marouane’s supervision.


**Jean-Baptiste Soufron: Legal Advisor**

Lawyer and writer, he is known for his high expertise in the digital realm. His mastership and passion led him to be the Chief Legal Officer of the Wikimedia Foundation and director of the think tank Cap Digital. He was also General Secretary of the Conseil National du Numérique after being an advisor to french President François Holland.
